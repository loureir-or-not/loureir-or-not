# Hey, didn't see you there.

Welcome to my cool profile! Here you can find... uhh... my
README?

Yeah, doesn't look all that glamourous right now...

## What do I do?

I am a self-taught programmer that likes to write in just about
anything. However, people consider me a shiny programmer because
I am a Gentoo-based WSL user, mostly because Windows is really
comfortable if you know how to get rid of its cruft... though
NVIDIA is also a concern.
