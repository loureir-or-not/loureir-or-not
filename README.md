# Hey, didn't see you there.

Welcome to my cool profile! Here you can find... uhh... my README?

Yeah, doesn't look all that glamourous right now...

## What do I do?

I am a self-taught programmer that likes to write in just about
anything. I am a Gentoo-based WSL user, mostly because Windows
is really comfortable if you know how to get rid of its cruft...
though NVIDIA is also a concern.
